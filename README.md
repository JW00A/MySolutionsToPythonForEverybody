The solutions are for exercises for Python for Everybody from this site(https://www.py4e.com/book).

Note: These solutions are intended for people/learners who have already attempted the exercises on their own or are looking to compare and improve their approach. Theyâ€™re not meant as shortcuts but as a reference for reflection and discussion.
